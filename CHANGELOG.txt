- vampires now show their fake names/ages to match DF
- nicknames are now set properly and won't disappear after notable kills
- animals can be grouped on caste
- grouping animals on race groups by the race name, then child/baby name: dog (puppy)
- grouping on migration wave will properly hide child/baby groups according to options

### v11.1 (DF 34.08 - DF 34.10 SDL)

***

- fixed labor column sorting when there are no related roles - added swimmer skill column to military default view
- applied ag's linux patch for nicknames and performance issues on linux
- fixed a bug with modded games (masterwork) showing tame animals as hostile
- added missing linux offsets to layout files
- some squad loading optimization
- fixed a bug on linux regarding the active vs full unit list offsets (they now have their own separate offsets)
- added missing roles (bowyer, cheesemaker, trapper, small animal dissector, dyer, fish cleaner, fish dissector, clothier, siege engineer)
- included the fix for conflicting labors (hunting/mining/woodcutting)
- attribute description ranges, and drawing icon (ie. 'strong', 'very strong'..) are based on caste values now. columns are still sorted on the absolute value, however the description and the drawing icon (square, number..) are relative to the caste. essentially this means for modders the descriptions in DT will match those in game.
- castes, races and reactions are read from memory now to give more accurate and correct race/reaction descriptions
- you can now CTRL+left click dwarfs to select them, and then toggle multiple labors at once
- ESC now deselects all currently selected dwarfs
- added an option under roles to show role ratings in labor columns. this additionally changes the sorting of labor columns to sort by labor enabled and then role rating so the dwarfs with the labor enabled are still shown on top
- fixed role trait ratings and tweaked accuracy
- migration issues completely resolved now, and grouping by migration wave shows season and year of arrival/birth
- custom animal views can show animal attributes (ensure your custom view starts with Animals
- active unit lists are used instead of the full list, which should resolve issues like kidnapped babies, etc..

### v10.3 (DF 34.04 - DF 34.08) >>DOWNLOAD<<

***

- added new jobs and minecart hauling labors
- added new minecart labor to default views
- updated memory offsets and added new layout files
- always show animal children regardles of options
- fixed role display/editing bugs
- now hides hostile/wild animals
- shows how trained animals are in the names on the animals tab
- counts show up for animals now
- added animal type offsets
- updated linux offsets for turn count
- babies are excluded from role calculations now and added a tooltip on roles for babies saying just that
- children are only included in role calculations if they're shown
- threaded the heavy role calc work (well most of it)
- fixed some custom role editing bugs
- changed the migrant check back to the previous flag checks, misc traits don't seem to work for it

Roles
- added user interface for custom roles (scripts not supported)
- added top roles in dwarf tooltip (number can be set in options)
- the number of roles in the dwarf detail pane can be set in the options now
- modified the way roles ratings are calculated again. it now rates aspects on more static/absolute values and then ranks dwarves according to each other. due to this the mean/stdev/etc. functions are no longer available for scripts as they're no longer calculated. (thanks to thistleknot, thuvian and dreiche2 for your help on this)
- more default roles have been added/adjusted

Interface
- all the tables in the dwarf details pane can be re-sized or hidden and settings are saved
- the population count now displays a breakdown of adults/children/babies including a tooltip with totals
- sort direction/column for the tables in the dwarf details pane is remembered
- fixed more sorting issues on menus and more menus have tear-off enabled
- fixed some minor drawing issues
- custom professions can now be marked as being a mask. if set as a mask they will only add labours
- made some adjustments to the progress bar on the bottom and messages
- tweaked trait/skill/role tooltips
- when editing custom views you don't have to find white space to add columns anymore
- added a tooltip to the version message at the bottom right which shows the path of the file being used (for those who make copies in the layout folder...)

Weapon Columns
- a new type of column has been added to compare a dwarf's size to the requirements of weapons to aid in determining which dwarves can use which weapons
- all weapons are read from the raws and are automatically grouped by sizes and added to their own view
- additionally, if there are 10 or less grouped weapon columns, it will append it to the military view as well
- an indicator and tooltip is shown for whether or not the dwarf can one-hand, two-hand or is unable to use the weapons in the group
- individual weapon columns can also be added just like other columns. This doesn't apply for the grouped columns as they're generated dynamically on load. If there's enough demand I'll look into making them available

Other/Fixes
- migration waves should be grouping dwarves properly (courtesy of Shishimar)
- added another check for corpse/zombies to ensure they don't show up in DT
- traits are capped at 0 and 100 for those few crazy values that sometimes occur
- if not showing cursed dwarves, the 'drinking blood' job is changed to 'drink'

- changed the syntax of custom roles. see the game_data.ini for plenty of examples
- updated all craft related roles to weigh creativity the most
- custom roles have been moved to the dwarf therapist.ini. they should be added under the [custom_roles] heading
- custom roles can now override a default role column if it is given the same name
- d.skill_mean(id), d.skill_stdev(id), d.trait_mean(id), d.trait_stdev(id) have been added for scripting purposes
- scripted role columns will now draw correctly as long as the value is between 0 and 100
- all menus when adding columns to custom views can be 'torn off' to aid in adding many columns at once (click the --- line at the top to tear off)
- fixed changed/missing current jobs
- migrants not on the map yet will show up in DT again

### v7 (DF 34.04 - DF 34.05)

***

Guide to Roles
Q. How does the weighting work?
A. Weights come in two main categories: individually or globally. Individual weights are placed on individual aspects (trait, attribute, skill) and give them value relative to the others in the group. For example, if you wanted strength to be worth more than agility relative to attributes, you would give strength a higher weight.

The second category is for the global weights. These are applied to each of the 3 aspect groups (attributes, skills and traits) after individual weights are applied. Essentially this is like saying, for example: "I would like attributes, in general, to be worth more than traits".

Q. How do I add a custom role?
A. Navigate to your Dwarf Therapist.ini file. Append [custom_roles] to the end of the file if it's not already there. Within this section is where you can define custom roles. The first line should be size=x, where x is the number of custom roles you have. Finally add the aspects for the roles. Here is an example of a chief medical dwarf:

1/name="Chief Medical"
1/attributes_weight=1.0 (optional weight for the attributes group, if not supplied will use value in options)
1/skills_weight=1.0 (optional weight for the skills group, if not supplied will use value in options)
1/traits_weight=1.0 (optional weight for the traits group, if not supplied will use value in options)
1/attributes/size=3 (number of attributes)
1/attributes/1/id=analytical ability
1/attributes/1/weight=0.5 (optional individual weight)
1/attributes/2/id=memory
1/attributes/3/id=intuition
1/skills/size=1 (number of skills)
1/skills/1/id=60
1/traits/size = 2 (number of traits)
1/traits/1/id=20
1/traits/2/id=23

Notes:
You can look up trait and skill id numbers by opening the script->new script menu. The right side contains reference tables.
The 1 at the beginning of the line is the role's index or id. The next custom role added to this list would replace all 1/ at the beginning with 2/.

Q. How do I create a custom role that uses a script?
A. You add these the same as a regular custom role, however you leave out all the attribute/trait/skill sections and simply add a script="" area. For example:
1/name="Script Column"
1/script="your script here"

Note that you should not use scripts that have comparison operators (<, >, >=, =) and do not put comments in the script. The script should result in a value for each dwarf.

Q. How do I value an aspect inversely? (ie. less strength is better)
A. Simply add a - sign before the id of the attribute, skill or trait. For example:
1/name="Weak Dwarf"
1/attributes/size=1
1/attributes/1/id=-strength

Q. How do I replace one of the default roles in the Roles view?
A.Simply add a custom role with the same name. It will be used in place of the default role on the Roles tab with that name.

Additional Role Information:

Role columns allow users to specify which aspects (attributes, traits and skills) they would like associated with a particular role. these roles can be weighted on the individual elements, as well as the groups. syntax for creating roles is as follows:

<number>/name="<role name>" <number>/attributes="<attribute group weight>::<attribute name 1>:<individual weight 1>, <attribute name 2>:<individual weight 2>..."
<number>/skills="<skill group weight>::<skill id 1>:<individual weight 1>, <skill id 2>:<individual weight 2>..."
<number>/traits="<trait group weight>::<trait id 1>:<individual weight 1>, <trait id 2>:<individual weight 2>"
<number>/script=""

script is optional and will be used instead of any aspects, so it's either a script, or aspects.

Examples:

Chief Medical Dwarf with attributes: analytical, memory and intuition, traits: helpfulness and compassion, and skills: diagnostician
1/name="Chief Medical"
1/attributes="0.25::analytical ability:1.0, memory:1.0, intuition:1.0"
1/skills="0.75::60:1.0"
1/traits="1.25::20:1.0, 23:1.0"
Weak Lawdwarf (hammerer that has less chance to kill)
36/name="Lawdwarf (Weak)"
36/attributes="0.25::-strength,-agility,-endurance"
36/traits="1.25::-1"
36/skills=""
here we use the - to denote that we don't want these aspects, so this will rate the weakest dwarf, not prone to anger as the best choice for a weak lawdwarf.

all the id numbers can be found in the game_data.ini, or if you create a new script via the menu, there are tables there as well.

### v3 (DF 34.03-34.04)

***

- fixed issues with mental attributes and their level/ratings not aligning properly
- added offsets for 34.03 and 34.04 and respective files
- updated offsets for mental attributes

### v2 (DF 34.01-34.02)

***

- added mental attribute offsets (willpower, musicality, etc..)
- added new default view/tab for attributes
- added option to draw the column headers from top to bottom
- fixed a bug when applying filters while hiding children/babies
- slightly tweaked the threshold for traits so more of them are visible
- included the current year offset so ages show up properly

### v1 (DF 34.01)

***

- adds strength, agility, toughness, endurance and disease resistance
- updated attribute columns to draw based on user settings (numbers, growing boxes, etc.)
- modified the scaling on attributes to better utilize the draw types (for example with growing boxes the highest attribute will show a diamond, the lowest the tiny square)
- updated the default views to include all attributes on the military tab
- updated the default views to show "Average" instead of a blank for attribute values that fall close to the mean
- seems like animals are also working but it shows hidden and merchant animals as well, haven't really tested it
- adds the ability to set nicknames to multiple dwarves at once

RELEASE 0.5.2 (May 18, 2010)
CHANGES SINCE 0.5.1
===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
 * Support for 0.31.04
 * MemoryLayouts now have a concept of being "complete" or not. DT will not try
   to load values on startup if the detected layout file is "incomplete"
   (complete means the file doesn't contain a "complete = false" line in its
   [info] section. This should help for mapping new versions.
MINOR CHANGES:

 * Added dump to file context menu action for dwarves (Fixes issue 224)
 * Greatly sped up raw data reads on linux (also uses less ram)

 * Confirmed fixes migrants not loading (Fixes issue 218)
 * Sorting fix (fixes issue 220)
 * Fixed crash on right click in grid views dock (Fixes issue 219)


RELEASE 0.5.1 (April 24, 2010)
CHANGES SINCE 0.5.0
===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
 * Stable Support for 0.31.03
 * game_data.ini no longer lists checksum->memory_layout entries anymore
   (They are now discovered by reading *.ini in your platform's memory_layout
   directory) Any .ini file found with a valid info section will be added to
   the memory layout list. This prevents repeating the same data in different
   places and enables new layout files to be delivered in the future by just
   dropping them in the correct directory.
 * The "can't talk to this version" warning dialog got a face lift. Since we now
   read in all memory layouts, the dialog can show which versions of DF can be
   talked to. This hopefully gives a bit more actionble information to the user.
   It also links to the wiki.
MINOR CHANGES:
 * New group-by method "Highest Skill" groups dwarves by their highest actual skill level
 * New group-by method "Total Skill Levels" groups dwarves by their total number of skill ranks
 * Added a progress bar the Main windows's status bar (dwarf loading uses it now)
BUG FIXES:
 * Fix for leatherworking and tanning mixup on the grid
 * Fixed issue 206. (wrong name for skill level 2)
 * Fixed crash in Scanner if creature_vector is incorrect
 * Profession 63 is Diagnoser not Suturer (fixes issue 205)
 * Applied locale-aware sorting patch from Zhentar (fixes issue 190)
 * Some translation fixes for setting Dwarf nicknames.
 * Added new group by "Highest skill" option (Fixes issue 180)
 * Added method to group by total skill level (Related to issue 180)
 * Fix sorting for integer based group-by options (such as Highest skill, migration wave etc...)


RELEASE 0.5.0 (April 10, 2010)
CHANGES SINCE 0.4.3

MAJOR CHANGES:
 * Stable Support for 0.31.01 and 0.31.02
MINOR CHANGES:
 * more informative error when connecting to unknown versions of DF
 * Show the checksum of a DF version that can't be talked to (to assist with adding support for new versions)
 * MemoryLayout now checks to make sure a file exists before blindly reading crap
 * added new types of dwarf jobs MEDICAL and FURNACE (furnace still needs an icon)
BUG FIXES:
 * Fixed flag validation for dwarfs (merchants, guards, liasons, corpses should no longer show up in the main list)
 * Fixed skill display for dwarfs
 * Fixed trait display for dwarfs
 * Fixed current-job display for dwarfs
 * Fixed issue 189. (long/multipart surname reading)
 * Fixed issue 173. (migration waves sort order)
 * Fixed issue 157. (add option for hiding dabbling skills)
 * Made military status names translatable (and made the baby/child search text based instead of using ids)
 * Removed print button since it was just for playing around with
 * Fixed issue 193. (some flags are required to be on a dwarf)
 * Fixed issue 201. (mechanic skill id incorrect)

 * Added new grouping method "Current Job", and it rules (Fixed issue 9)
 * GridViews are now either custom or built-in. Built-in gridviews cannot be edited. (Fixed issue 147)
 * Welcome back Athlon owners! Fixed problem running on non-SSE2 processors (Athlon) (Fixed issue 120)
MINOR CHANGES:
 * You can now have custom professions that have the same name as a default profession,
   and trying to delete that custom profession (for instance "Miner") will force you to
   change the profession for all dwarfs that have the custom profession set to "Miner",
   but not dwarfs whose main default profession is "Miner" (Fixed issue 144)
 * Added AttributeColumns (Fixes issue 122)
 * Added a name completer to the filter box (guesses names based on what's been typed)
   Searching for characters that don't start a dwarf name still works though.
 * Added labor cheating option to main options tab (when checked you can set labors on anything) (Fixed issue 125)
BUG FIXES:
 * Fixed Happiness labels (Content has a range of 50 points not 25) (Fixed issue 139)
 * Professions now all have male and female versions of their title (only used for Baron, Count etc...) (Fixed issue 140)
 * Fixed invalidation flags in all windows versions for filtering out invaders and the undead
   This should fix non-site dwarfs showing in the list (Fixed issue 116)
 * Added more checks for lost connections (for those that turn off the alert) (Fixed issue 129)
 * Fix Bulk Toggle (Hauling, etc) Does Not Display Changes On Grid (work on issue 135)
 * Duplicate name defense on ViewColumnSet::add_column(), dupe names now get incremental numbers appended to their name
 * Added "Set Profession Text" Option on Right-Click Context Menu for dwarfs (Fixes issue 130)
 * Tabs now properly update after editing gridviews that are currently shown (and not shown)
 * Fixed bad drawing of happiness cells (no OS highlight anymore)
 * Attempting to add a Grid view that has been deleted triggers crash (Fixed issue 124)
 * Fixed broken labor sorting (Fixed issue 117)
 * Split "Grid Colors" from "Grid options" section of Options screen (Fixed issue 126)


RELEASE 0.4.1 (October 6, 2009)
CHANGES SINCE 0.4.0
===============================================================================

MINOR CHANGES:
 * DwarfDetailsDock now shows a better default screen on load
BUG FIXES:
 * Fixed showstopper for folks using custom professions (issues 112 and 114) This was a bug
   preventing users from being able to toggle labors for some dwarfs with custom professions set.

RELEASE 0.4.0 (October 3, 2009)

===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
 * Full re-write of the sets and views handler. View customization now rules if I may say so myself. (Fixed issue 89)
 * Custom views can now be imported/exported like custom professions (this should get us sharing views!)
 * New dwarf details dialog is epic (Fixes issue 95)
MINOR CHANGES:
 * Labors can now include an "excludes" list which will make sure only one of the professions in list can be active at a time. (Fixes issue 91)
 * Column headers now highlight as you move around the main cells (Fixes issue 80)
 * Views now remember selected dwarfs when switching tabs, sort order, or grouping (Fixes issue 108)
 * Added new option for alerting when connection is lost to DF (Fixes issue 102)
 * Added new option for checking for updates on startup
 * Reworked the about menu to allow manual update checks.
 * Options menu is now broken into different tabs with better tooltips for each options (Fixed issue 105)
 * Added a mechanism for HappinessColumn to update itself independent from DwarfModel redraws (much faster)
 * HappinessColumn now draws an aggregate cell that shows the lowest happiness in a group for (eye-catching-ness)
 * Hacked up ColorPickerButton a bit to show the hex code of custom colors
 * There is now a display for total number of dwarfs next to the big number of pending changes display (Fixed issue 100)

 * You can now dump memory for a dwarf to a text dialog (not for general use)
 * Dwarf detail dock now shows attributes as well as a graph for when the next attribute will be gained
 * Skill legend dock now allows right click to change the active skill drawing method (Fixes issue 85)
BUG FIXES:
 * Fixed color choosers not remembering the last custom color used (Fixed issue 103)
 * Removed incorrect entries in the non_labor_professions (Fixed issues 87 & 106)
 * Fixed a bug where set re-ordering wasn't being persisted after editing.
 * Fixed a stupid bug where any GridView being changed caused ViewManager to write/read/redraw/write/read/redraw (this took almost 3 seconds in debug builds) Much much faster handling of this now.
 * Fixed a bug where newly added sets were promptly thrown away after accepting the edit dialog :)
 * Fixed a bug in the SpacerColumn ctor that did not explicitly set a width (spacers with a width of -8923232 don't look quite right, BTW)
 * Fixed a bug in the ViewColumn QSettings-based ctor where the column was not being automatically added to the set that was passed in
 * fixed a stupid thing I was doing with the GridViewDock (allowing context menus anywhere on the widget), also added a "new set" action to the GridViewDock's context menu.
 * Fixed some bugs with column re-ordering in a set
 * Added icons to the GridViewDock context menu
 * Fixed a bug where skill columns weren't being drawn in the editor
 * Fixed a bug where the user's tab order wasn't being saved on changes
 * Fixed a bug where DT only recognized 6 happiness levels to support all 7 that actually exist
 * Additional languages cause dwarf names to be wrong (Fixes issue 101)
 * Reworked the XP displays that were broken in the 0.3.2 release (Fixes issue 93)
 * Fixed bug where overridden column background colors weren't being honored (Fixes issue 86)
 * Reverse sort the special column types so that "Spacer" is the default instead of "Happiness" when editing a column set (Fixed issue 90)

RELEASE 0.3.2 (September 13, 2009)
CHANGES SINCE 0.3.1
===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
   * added support for 40d15 & 40d16 on Windows
   * re-implemented experience display. Tooltips now show experience as:
     "current/nextlevel (%progress)" (issue 67)
   * Fixed up tooltips for skill and labor columns to nicely show skills with
     true level and experience (issues 75,77)
   * Fixed the window finding issues on XP and Vista (Thanks to Guhndahb and
     0x517A5D)
MINOR CHANGES:
   * Added non-labor setting professions (child, baby, noble etc...) This
     should keep users from setting illegal labors (issue 60)
   * tooltips now show the generic translation of a dwarf's name (issues 68,
     70, 76)
   * fixed a bug where the translation tables were read despite having 0 values
     (issues 68, 70, 76)
   * Labor changes not added if Read Dwarves is pressed before Commit Changes
     (issue 69)
   * Got rid of both library dependencies on both windows and linux (they are
     statically compiled in making building easier)
   * Windows now maps memory segments the same way linux does, this prevents
     access violations etc..., making sure we only read known committed
     readable memory segments
FEATURE REQUESTS:
 * Added option to show full dwarf names in the options menu (requires
   re-reading the dwarfs due to caching) (issue 66)
 * added new option to always expand all groups (feature request 83)
 * Enabled labors with no skill in the labor now get a slight boost in sort
   order. So if you sort a labor by skill, enabled-but-unskilled dwarfs will
   show just after dabbling dwarves. (feature request 78)
 * Added a new skill drawing method SDM_NUMERIC which draws numbers for the
   level on the grid (looks good actually) (issues 75,77)
 * Re-did the other SKILL_DRAWING_METHODs to differentiate between 0xp and
   dabbling. Something is now draw for each of them if skill is over 0exp.
   (issues 75,77)
 * Skill objects now default to a -1 rating instead of 0 (this was causing a
   merge between dabbling and 0 experience) (issues 75,77)
 * reworked the dwarf tooltips (show profession in tooltip) (issues 68, 70,
    76)


RELEASE 0.3.1 (August 19, 2009)
CHANGES SINCE 0.3.0
===============================================================================
 * HappinessColumn tooltip now shows the english version of the happiness level
 * Skills now correctly read experience (Fixed issue 1)
 * fixed issue 58 (can't repro it anymore)
 * Added ability to toggle an entire set at once for a dwarf or a group of
   dwarfs
 * added support for 40d14
 * (Fixed issue 5): Show skill-ratings legend somewhere
 * Moved the dock config around. Views, Sets, and Skill legend docks are now
   off by default and can be turned on in a variety of ways. They also default
   to floating windows that can be docked.
 * (Fixed issue 42): Hangs if game saved/continued without reloading
 * DT now heartbeats every second to DF. It a fort is unloaded or the game
   exits, DT will disconnect and allow reconnection.
 * (Implemented issue 40): Profession mgmt - separate file/export
 * Fixed a minor drawing bug with selected rows not showing the main grid
   underneath
 * Fixed a bug where the Viewmanager would try to draw tabs with invalid indexes
 * (Fixed issue 55): Confirm overwrite if View or Set name exists
    This dialog only pops up when you aren't editing. To prevent accidental
    clobbering.
    Cases where it shows up:
       Edit View1, change the name to View2(which already exists)
       New view, change the name to View2(which already exists)
       Will not show up on edit if the original name was View3 and you save it as
         View3.
    Since it doesn't show up in the general case, I've opted to not implement
    the "don't ask me again" checkbox
 * (Fixed issue 54) Blank name is allowed for set name
 * (Fixed issue 53) Main window doesn't show changes after changing group by
 * generic_useless.ini set wasn't correct, so I removed it
 * StateTableView now remembers which rows were expanded and which weren't
 * Setting the group by now goes thru ViewManager so the columns don't get
   stretched incorrectly
 * (Fixed issue 57) Dwarf Name column resets to fixed-width
 * (Fixed issue 63) Options Window Duplicates Custom Professions
 * (Fixes issue 61) customizable skill icons
 * (Fixes issue 62) option to turn of shading
 * some minor speedups based on a trial of profiler
 * Dwarf::nice_name() is now cached since it hardly ever changes
 * GameDataReader now caches skill names and skill level names (and uses them)
 * UberDelegate now passes adjusted rectangles by reference to the sub-painters
   for less stack thrashing
 * Less QString::operator+ usage, since it seems to cause reallocations and is
   generally slow as fucking hell
 * Found some spots where build_rows() was being called multiple times and
   being slow
