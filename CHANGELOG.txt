RELEASE 0.5.2 (May 18, 2010)
CHANGES SINCE 0.5.1
===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
 * Support for 0.31.04
 * MemoryLayouts now have a concept of being "complete" or not. DT will not try
   to load values on startup if the detected layout file is "incomplete" 
   (complete means the file doesn't contain a "complete = false" line in its 
   [info] section. This should help for mapping new versions.
MINOR CHANGES:
 * Added a "copy address to clipboard" method to dwarf context menu
 * Added dump to file context menu action for dwarves (Fixes issue 224)
 * Greatly sped up raw data reads on linux (also uses less ram)
 * Compiles and runs on Linux again (no memory layouts yet)
BUG FIXES:
 * Confirmed fixes migrants not loading (Fixes issue 218)
 * Sorting fix (fixes issue 220)
 * Fixed crash on right click in grid views dock (Fixes issue 219)


RELEASE 0.5.1 (April 24, 2010)
CHANGES SINCE 0.5.0
===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
 * Stable Support for 0.31.03
 * game_data.ini no longer lists checksum->memory_layout entries anymore 
   (They are now discovered by reading *.ini in your platform's memory_layout 
   directory) Any .ini file found with a valid info section will be added to 
   the memory layout list. This prevents repeating the same data in different 
   places and enables new layout files to be delivered in the future by just 
   dropping them in the correct directory.
 * The "can't talk to this version" warning dialog got a face lift. Since we now
   read in all memory layouts, the dialog can show which versions of DF can be 
   talked to. This hopefully gives a bit more actionble information to the user.
   It also links to the wiki.
MINOR CHANGES:
 * New group-by method "Highest Skill" groups dwarves by their highest actual skill level
 * New group-by method "Total Skill Levels" groups dwarves by their total number of skill ranks
 * Added a progress bar the Main windows's status bar (dwarf loading uses it now)
BUG FIXES:
 * Fix for leatherworking and tanning mixup on the grid
 * Fixed issue 206. (wrong name for skill level 2)
 * Fixed crash in Scanner if creature_vector is incorrect
 * Profession 63 is Diagnoser not Suturer (fixes issue 205)
 * Applied locale-aware sorting patch from Zhentar (fixes issue 190)
 * Some translation fixes for setting Dwarf nicknames.
 * Added new group by "Highest skill" option (Fixes issue 180)
 * Added method to group by total skill level (Related to issue 180)
 * Fix sorting for integer based group-by options (such as Highest skill, migration wave etc...)

 * Show the checksum of a DF version that can't be talked to (to assist with adding support for new versions)
 * MemoryLayout now checks to make sure a file exists before blindly reading crap
 * added new types of dwarf jobs MEDICAL and FURNACE (furnace still needs an icon)
BUG FIXES:
 * Fixed flag validation for dwarfs (merchants, guards, liasons, corpses should no longer show up in the main list)
 * Fixed skill display for dwarfs 
 * Fixed trait display for dwarfs
 * Fixed current-job display for dwarfs
 * Fixed issue 189. (long/multipart surname reading)

 * Fixed issue 157. (add option for hiding dabbling skills)
 * Made military status names translatable (and made the baby/child search text based instead of using ids)
 * Removed print button since it was just for playing around with
 * Fixed issue 193. (some flags are required to be on a dwarf)

 * Welcome back Athlon owners! Fixed problem running on non-SSE2 processors (Athlon) (Fixed issue 120)
MINOR CHANGES: 
 * You can now have custom professions that have the same name as a default profession, 
   and trying to delete that custom profession (for instance "Miner") will force you to 
   change the profession for all dwarfs that have the custom profession set to "Miner", 
   but not dwarfs whose main default profession is "Miner" (Fixed issue 144)
 * Added AttributeColumns (Fixes issue 122)
 * Added a name completer to the filter box (guesses names based on what's been typed)

MINOR CHANGES:
 * DwarfDetailsDock now shows a better default screen on load
BUG FIXES:

===============================================================================

 * Added a mechanism for HappinessColumn to update itself independent from DwarfModel redraws (much faster)
 * HappinessColumn now draws an aggregate cell that shows the lowest happiness in a group for (eye-catching-ness)

 * Removed incorrect entries in the non_labor_professions (Fixed issues 87 & 106)
 * Fixed a bug where set re-ordering wasn't being persisted after editing.
 * Fixed a stupid bug where any GridView being changed caused ViewManager to write/read/redraw/write/read/redraw (this took almost 3 seconds in debug builds) Much much faster handling of this now.

 * Fixed a bug in the SpacerColumn ctor that did not explicitly set a width (spacers with a width of -8923232 don't look quite right, BTW)
 * Fixed a bug in the ViewColumn QSettings-based ctor where the column was not being automatically added to the set that was passed in
 * fixed a stupid thing I was doing with the GridViewDock (allowing context menus anywhere on the widget), also added a "new set" action to the GridViewDock's context menu.

RELEASE 0.3.2 (September 13, 2009)
CHANGES SINCE 0.3.1
===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
	* added support for 40d15 & 40d16 on Windows
	* re-implemented experience display. Tooltips now show experience as: 
	  "current/nextlevel (%progress)" (issue 67)
	* Fixed up tooltips for skill and labor columns to nicely show skills with 
	  true level and experience (issues 75,77)
	* Fixed the window finding issues on XP and Vista (Thanks to Guhndahb and 
	  0x517A5D) 
MINOR CHANGES:
	* Added non-labor setting professions (child, baby, noble etc...) This 
	  should keep users from setting illegal labors (issue 60)
	* tooltips now show the generic translation of a dwarf's name (issues 68, 
	  70, 76)
	* fixed a bug where the translation tables were read despite having 0 values
	  (issues 68, 70, 76)
	* Labor changes not added if Read Dwarves is pressed before Commit Changes 
	  (issue 69)
	* Got rid of both library dependencies on both windows and linux (they are 
	  statically compiled in making building easier)
	* Windows now maps memory segments the same way linux does, this prevents 
	  access violations etc..., making sure we only read known committed 
	  readable memory segments
FEATURE REQUESTS:
 * Added option to show full dwarf names in the options menu (requires 
   re-reading the dwarfs due to caching) (issue 66)
 * added new option to always expand all groups (feature request 83)
 * Enabled labors with no skill in the labor now get a slight boost in sort 
   order. So if you sort a labor by skill, enabled-but-unskilled dwarfs will 
   show just after dabbling dwarves. (feature request 78)
 * Added a new skill drawing method SDM_NUMERIC which draws numbers for the 
   level on the grid (looks good actually) (issues 75,77)
 * Re-did the other SKILL_DRAWING_METHODs to differentiate between 0xp and 
   dabbling. Something is now draw for each of them if skill is over 0exp. 
   (issues 75,77)
 * Skill objects now default to a -1 rating instead of 0 (this was causing a 
   merge between dabbling and 0 experience) (issues 75,77)
 * reworked the dwarf tooltips (show profession in tooltip) (issues 68, 70, 
	 76)
 

RELEASE 0.3.1 (August 19, 2009)
CHANGES SINCE 0.3.0
===============================================================================
 * HappinessColumn tooltip now shows the english version of the happiness level
 * Skills now correctly read experience (Fixed issue 1)
 * fixed issue 58 (can't repro it anymore)
 * Added ability to toggle an entire set at once for a dwarf or a group of 
   dwarfs
 * added support for 40d14
 * (Fixed issue 5): Show skill-ratings legend somewhere
 * Moved the dock config around. Views, Sets, and Skill legend docks are now 
   off by default and can be turned on in a variety of ways. They also default 
   to floating windows that can be docked.
 * (Fixed issue 42): Hangs if game saved/continued without reloading
 * DT now heartbeats every second to DF. It a fort is unloaded or the game 
   exits, DT will disconnect and allow reconnection.
 * (Implemented issue 40): Profession mgmt - separate file/export
 * Fixed a minor drawing bug with selected rows not showing the main grid 
   underneath
 * Fixed a bug where the Viewmanager would try to draw tabs with invalid indexes
 * (Fixed issue 55): Confirm overwrite if View or Set name exists
	 This dialog only pops up when you aren't editing. To prevent accidental 
	 clobbering.
	 Cases where it shows up:
		 Edit View1, change the name to View2(which already exists)
		 New view, change the name to View2(which already exists)
		 Will not show up on edit if the original name was View3 and you save it as 
		   View3.
	 Since it doesn't show up in the general case, I've opted to not implement 
	 the "don't ask me again" checkbox
 * (Fixed issue 54) Blank name is allowed for set name
 * (Fixed issue 53) Main window doesn't show changes after changing group by
 * generic_useless.ini set wasn't correct, so I removed it
 * StateTableView now remembers which rows were expanded and which weren't
 * Setting the group by now goes thru ViewManager so the columns don't get 
   stretched incorrectly 
 * (Fixed issue 57) Dwarf Name column resets to fixed-width
 * (Fixed issue 63) Options Window Duplicates Custom Professions
 * (Fixes issue 61) customizable skill icons
 * (Fixes issue 62) option to turn of shading
 * some minor speedups based on a trial of profiler
 * Dwarf::nice_name() is now cached since it hardly ever changes
 * GameDataReader now caches skill names and skill level names (and uses them)
 * UberDelegate now passes adjusted rectangles by reference to the sub-painters
   for less stack thrashing
 * Less QString::operator+ usage, since it seems to cause reallocations and is
   generally slow as fucking hell
 * Found some spots where build_rows() was being called multiple times and 
   being slow
