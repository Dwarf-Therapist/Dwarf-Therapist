- modified background of default social view columns to be slightly darker
- added text and changed the icon of the 'add new grid view' button to make it more obvious
- added tooltips to the panes when adding new sets/columns to views

Recent Thoughts
- a dwarf's recent thoughts (most recent first) can be viewed in a dwarf's tooltip, and the happiness cell's tooltip in the grid
- added an additional dock window to view the population's thoughts with counts and effects on happiness

Custom Professions
- custom profession icons can now have a background color in addition to an icon and text
- the default profession icons can be modified by right clicking on them
- custom profession icons or changed default profession icons now show properly in tooltips, the dwarf pane, etc..

Roles
- roles now use a weighted average of the interpolated skill level and a simulated rating method which takes into account the dwarf's learning rate for the skill.
- added an option in the defaults to choose the weight for the skill rates relative to the skill level (only applies with mods with multiple castes)
- roles now use a weighted average of the attribute's value, and it's potential value
- added an additional weight for attribute's potential relative to the attribute's value

Skills & Rust
- default skill rates (100%) aren't shown in the skill tooltips any longer
- skill rust levels are now shown in varying colors of orange in the tooltip and the dwarf details pane.

Mod Support (Specifically with Multiple Castes)
- when using multiple castes attribute ratings are determined from a combined method incorporating the caste's frequency, and the attribute's potential
- when using multiple castes the vanilla trait shifting of the median values is disabled as it seems the raw trait ranges are currently broken
- additionally the attributes with multiple castes will append the caste name to the descriptor for clarity (ie. very strong for a caste-name-here). this doesn't apply to animals.
- when not using multiple castes all skill learning rate displays and calculations are disabled and hidden
- attributes are drawn on an absolute rating now, so you don't need to group by caste to discern values

Groups & Sorting
- added group by age
- added group by caste tag (only visible when using mods with multiple castes) with appropriate spoiler warning
- added sorting by age to the right click menu on the main column
- sorting while grouping sorts not only the dwarfs in the groups, but the groups themselves (applies to most groupings)

Attributes

- added a few more job icons
- fixed a bug where carve fortification wouldn't show up as a job

Labor Optimizer
- squads can now be excluded from labor optimizations

Skill Legend

- when a dwarf goes into a mood, the artifact name is hidden until they've actually completed it

### Version 19.2 Patch Notes

***

Skill Rate Experience Bonuses
- NOTE: the bonus xp information will only be shown if significant skill rates (>125%) are found. this means for vanilla, you won't see any skill bonus information, as normally everything is at 100% (the normal/default)
- added skill xp rates offset and list to castes
- roles take into account skill xp rates now, balanced with the skill ratings equally
- added skill xp rate information on skill related columns, and the dwarf details pane

- an indicator and tooltip is shown for whether or not the dwarf can one-hand, two-hand or is unable to use the weapons in the group
- individual weapon columns can also be added just like other columns. This doesn't apply for the grouped columns as they're generated dynamically on load. If there's enough demand I'll look into making them available

Guide to Roles
Q. How does the weighting work?
A. Weights come in two main categories: individually or globally. Individual weights are placed on individual aspects (trait, attribute, skill) and give them value relative to the others in the group. For example, if you wanted strength to be worth more than agility relative to attributes, you would give strength a higher weight.

The second category is for the global weights. These are applied to each of the 3 aspect groups (attributes, skills and traits) after individual weights are applied. Essentially this is like saying, for example: "I would like attributes, in general, to be worth more than traits".

Q. How do I add a custom role?
A. Navigate to your Dwarf Therapist.ini file. Append [custom_roles] to the end of the file if it's not already there. Within this section is where you can define custom roles. The first line should be size=x, where x is the number of custom roles you have. Finally add the aspects for the roles. Here is an example of a chief medical dwarf:

1/name="Chief Medical"
1/attributes_weight=1.0 (optional weight for the attributes group, if not supplied will use value in options)
1/skills_weight=1.0 (optional weight for the skills group, if not supplied will use value in options)
1/traits_weight=1.0 (optional weight for the traits group, if not supplied will use value in options)
1/attributes/size=3 (number of attributes)
1/attributes/1/id=analytical ability
1/attributes/1/weight=0.5 (optional individual weight)
1/attributes/2/id=memory
1/attributes/3/id=intuition
1/skills/size=1 (number of skills)
1/skills/1/id=60
1/traits/size = 2 (number of traits)
1/traits/1/id=20
1/traits/2/id=23

Notes:
You can look up trait and skill id numbers by opening the script->new script menu. The right side contains reference tables.
The 1 at the beginning of the line is the role's index or id. The next custom role added to this list would replace all 1/ at the beginning with 2/.

Q. How do I create a custom role that uses a script?
A. You add these the same as a regular custom role, however you leave out all the attribute/trait/skill sections and simply add a script="" area. For example:
1/name="Script Column"
1/script="your script here"

Note that you should not use scripts that have comparison operators (<, >, >=, =) and do not put comments in the script. The script should result in a value for each dwarf.

Q. How do I value an aspect inversely? (ie. less strength is better)
A. Simply add a - sign before the id of the attribute, skill or trait. For example:
1/name="Weak Dwarf"
1/attributes/size=1
1/attributes/1/id=-strength

Q. How do I replace one of the default roles in the Roles view?
A.Simply add a custom role with the same name. It will be used in place of the default role on the Roles tab with that name.

Additional Role Information:

Role columns allow users to specify which aspects (attributes, traits and skills) they would like associated with a particular role. these roles can be weighted on the individual elements, as well as the groups. syntax for creating roles is as follows:

<number>/name="<role name>" <number>/attributes="<attribute group weight>::<attribute name 1>:<individual weight 1>, <attribute name 2>:<individual weight 2>..."
<number>/skills="<skill group weight>::<skill id 1>:<individual weight 1>, <skill id 2>:<individual weight 2>..."
<number>/traits="<trait group weight>::<trait id 1>:<individual weight 1>, <trait id 2>:<individual weight 2>"
<number>/script=""

script is optional and will be used instead of any aspects, so it's either a script, or aspects.

Examples:

Chief Medical Dwarf with attributes: analytical, memory and intuition, traits: helpfulness and compassion, and skills: diagnostician
1/name="Chief Medical"
1/attributes="0.25::analytical ability:1.0, memory:1.0, intuition:1.0"
1/skills="0.75::60:1.0"
1/traits="1.25::20:1.0, 23:1.0"
Weak Lawdwarf (hammerer that has less chance to kill)
36/name="Lawdwarf (Weak)"
36/attributes="0.25::-strength,-agility,-endurance"
36/traits="1.25::-1"
36/skills=""
here we use the - to denote that we don't want these aspects, so this will rate the weakest dwarf, not prone to anger as the best choice for a weak lawdwarf.

all the id numbers can be found in the game_data.ini, or if you create a new script via the menu, there are tables there as well.

### v2 (DF 34.01-34.02)

***

- added mental attribute offsets (willpower, musicality, etc..)
- added new default view/tab for attributes
- added option to draw the column headers from top to bottom
- fixed a bug when applying filters while hiding children/babies
- slightly tweaked the threshold for traits so more of them are visible
- included the current year offset so ages show up properly

### v1 (DF 34.01)

***

- adds strength, agility, toughness, endurance and disease resistance
- updated attribute columns to draw based on user settings (numbers, growing boxes, etc.)
- modified the scaling on attributes to better utilize the draw types (for example with growing boxes the highest attribute will show a diamond, the lowest the tiny square)
- updated the default views to include all attributes on the military tab
- updated the default views to show "Average" instead of a blank for attribute values that fall close to the mean
- seems like animals are also working but it shows hidden and merchant animals as well, haven't really tested it
- adds the ability to set nicknames to multiple dwarves at once

RELEASE 0.5.2 (May 18, 2010)
CHANGES SINCE 0.5.1
===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
 * Support for 0.31.04
 * MemoryLayouts now have a concept of being "complete" or not. DT will not try
   to load values on startup if the detected layout file is "incomplete"
   (complete means the file doesn't contain a "complete = false" line in its
   [info] section. This should help for mapping new versions.

 * Added dump to file context menu action for dwarves (Fixes issue 224)
 * Greatly sped up raw data reads on linux (also uses less ram)

RELEASE 0.5.1 (April 24, 2010)
CHANGES SINCE 0.5.0
===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
 * Stable Support for 0.31.03
 * game_data.ini no longer lists checksum->memory_layout entries anymore
   (They are now discovered by reading *.ini in your platform's memory_layout
   directory) Any .ini file found with a valid info section will be added to
   the memory layout list. This prevents repeating the same data in different
   places and enables new layout files to be delivered in the future by just
   dropping them in the correct directory.
 * The "can't talk to this version" warning dialog got a face lift. Since we now
   read in all memory layouts, the dialog can show which versions of DF can be
   talked to. This hopefully gives a bit more actionble information to the user.
   It also links to the wiki.
MINOR CHANGES:
 * New group-by method "Highest Skill" groups dwarves by their highest actual skill level
 * New group-by method "Total Skill Levels" groups dwarves by their total number of skill ranks
 * Added a progress bar the Main windows's status bar (dwarf loading uses it now)
BUG FIXES:
 * Fix for leatherworking and tanning mixup on the grid
 * Fixed issue 206. (wrong name for skill level 2)
 * Fixed crash in Scanner if creature_vector is incorrect
 * Profession 63 is Diagnoser not Suturer (fixes issue 205)
 * Applied locale-aware sorting patch from Zhentar (fixes issue 190)
 * Some translation fixes for setting Dwarf nicknames.
 * Added new group by "Highest skill" option (Fixes issue 180)
 * Added method to group by total skill level (Related to issue 180)
 * Fix sorting for integer based group-by options (such as Highest skill, migration wave etc...)

 * more informative error when connecting to unknown versions of DF
 * Show the checksum of a DF version that can't be talked to (to assist with adding support for new versions)
 * MemoryLayout now checks to make sure a file exists before blindly reading crap
 * added new types of dwarf jobs MEDICAL and FURNACE (furnace still needs an icon)
BUG FIXES:
 * Fixed flag validation for dwarfs (merchants, guards, liasons, corpses should no longer show up in the main list)
 * Fixed skill display for dwarfs
 * Fixed trait display for dwarfs
 * Fixed current-job display for dwarfs
 * Fixed issue 189. (long/multipart surname reading)
 * Fixed issue 173. (migration waves sort order)
 * Fixed issue 157. (add option for hiding dabbling skills)
 * Made military status names translatable (and made the baby/child search text based instead of using ids)
 * Removed print button since it was just for playing around with
 * Fixed issue 193. (some flags are required to be on a dwarf)
 * Fixed issue 201. (mechanic skill id incorrect)

 * Welcome back Athlon owners! Fixed problem running on non-SSE2 processors (Athlon) (Fixed issue 120)
MINOR CHANGES:
 * You can now have custom professions that have the same name as a default profession,
   and trying to delete that custom profession (for instance "Miner") will force you to
   change the profession for all dwarfs that have the custom profession set to "Miner",
   but not dwarfs whose main default profession is "Miner" (Fixed issue 144)
 * Added AttributeColumns (Fixes issue 122)
 * Added a name completer to the filter box (guesses names based on what's been typed)
   Searching for characters that don't start a dwarf name still works though.
 * Added labor cheating option to main options tab (when checked you can set labors on anything) (Fixed issue 125)
BUG FIXES:
 * Fixed Happiness labels (Content has a range of 50 points not 25) (Fixed issue 139)
 * Professions now all have male and female versions of their title (only used for Baron, Count etc...) (Fixed issue 140)
 * Fixed invalidation flags in all windows versions for filtering out invaders and the undead

 * Fixed bad drawing of happiness cells (no OS highlight anymore)
 * Attempting to add a Grid view that has been deleted triggers crash (Fixed issue 124)
 * Fixed broken labor sorting (Fixed issue 117)
 * Split "Grid Colors" from "Grid options" section of Options screen (Fixed issue 126)

MINOR CHANGES:
 * DwarfDetailsDock now shows a better default screen on load
BUG FIXES:
 * Fixed showstopper for folks using custom professions (issues 112 and 114) This was a bug
   preventing users from being able to toggle labors for some dwarfs with custom professions set.
 * Allow sorting when grouped by profession again (oversight)


RELEASE 0.4.0 (October 3, 2009)

===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
 * Full re-write of the sets and views handler. View customization now rules if I may say so myself. (Fixed issue 89)
 * Custom views can now be imported/exported like custom professions (this should get us sharing views!)
 * New dwarf details dialog is epic (Fixes issue 95)
MINOR CHANGES:
 * Labors can now include an "excludes" list which will make sure only one of the professions in list can be active at a time. (Fixes issue 91)
 * Column headers now highlight as you move around the main cells (Fixes issue 80)
 * Views now remember selected dwarfs when switching tabs, sort order, or grouping (Fixes issue 108)

 * Added a mechanism for HappinessColumn to update itself independent from DwarfModel redraws (much faster)
 * HappinessColumn now draws an aggregate cell that shows the lowest happiness in a group for (eye-catching-ness)
 * Hacked up ColorPickerButton a bit to show the hex code of custom colors
 * There is now a display for total number of dwarfs next to the big number of pending changes display (Fixed issue 100)
 * Views can now be copied via their context menus
 * You can now dump memory for a dwarf to a text dialog (not for general use)
 * Dwarf detail dock now shows attributes as well as a graph for when the next attribute will be gained

BUG FIXES:
 * Fixed color choosers not remembering the last custom color used (Fixed issue 103)
 * Removed incorrect entries in the non_labor_professions (Fixed issues 87 & 106)
 * Fixed a bug where set re-ordering wasn't being persisted after editing.
 * Fixed a stupid bug where any GridView being changed caused ViewManager to write/read/redraw/write/read/redraw (this took almost 3 seconds in debug builds) Much much faster handling of this now.
 * Fixed a bug where newly added sets were promptly thrown away after accepting the edit dialog :)
 * Fixed a bug in the SpacerColumn ctor that did not explicitly set a width (spacers with a width of -8923232 don't look quite right, BTW)
 * Fixed a bug in the ViewColumn QSettings-based ctor where the column was not being automatically added to the set that was passed in
 * fixed a stupid thing I was doing with the GridViewDock (allowing context menus anywhere on the widget), also added a "new set" action to the GridViewDock's context menu.
 * Fixed some bugs with column re-ordering in a set
 * Added icons to the GridViewDock context menu
 * Fixed a bug where skill columns weren't being drawn in the editor
 * Fixed a bug where the user's tab order wasn't being saved on changes

 * Reworked the XP displays that were broken in the 0.3.2 release (Fixes issue 93)
 * Fixed bug where overridden column background colors weren't being honored (Fixes issue 86)
 * Reverse sort the special column types so that "Spacer" is the default instead of "Happiness" when editing a column set (Fixed issue 90)
 * Fixed crash on windows when launched with option read on start set, and no DF version is running (Fixed issues 84, 99)


RELEASE 0.3.2 (September 13, 2009)
CHANGES SINCE 0.3.1
===============================================================================
MAJOR CHANGES:
   * added support for 40d15 & 40d16 on Windows
   * re-implemented experience display. Tooltips now show experience as:
     "current/nextlevel (%progress)" (issue 67)
   * Fixed up tooltips for skill and labor columns to nicely show skills with
     true level and experience (issues 75,77)
   * Fixed the window finding issues on XP and Vista (Thanks to Guhndahb and
     0x517A5D)
MINOR CHANGES:
   * Added non-labor setting professions (child, baby, noble etc...) This
     should keep users from setting illegal labors (issue 60)
   * tooltips now show the generic translation of a dwarf's name (issues 68,
     70, 76)
   * fixed a bug where the translation tables were read despite having 0 values
     (issues 68, 70, 76)
   * Labor changes not added if Read Dwarves is pressed before Commit Changes
     (issue 69)
   * Got rid of both library dependencies on both windows and linux (they are
     statically compiled in making building easier)
   * Windows now maps memory segments the same way linux does, this prevents
     access violations etc..., making sure we only read known committed
     readable memory segments
FEATURE REQUESTS:
 * Added option to show full dwarf names in the options menu (requires
   re-reading the dwarfs due to caching) (issue 66)
 * added new option to always expand all groups (feature request 83)
 * Enabled labors with no skill in the labor now get a slight boost in sort
   order. So if you sort a labor by skill, enabled-but-unskilled dwarfs will
   show just after dabbling dwarves. (feature request 78)
 * Added a new skill drawing method SDM_NUMERIC which draws numbers for the
   level on the grid (looks good actually) (issues 75,77)
 * Re-did the other SKILL_DRAWING_METHODs to differentiate between 0xp and
   dabbling. Something is now draw for each of them if skill is over 0exp.
   (issues 75,77)
 * Skill objects now default to a -1 rating instead of 0 (this was causing a
   merge between dabbling and 0 experience) (issues 75,77)
 * reworked the dwarf tooltips (show profession in tooltip) (issues 68, 70,
    76)


RELEASE 0.3.1 (August 19, 2009)
CHANGES SINCE 0.3.0
===============================================================================
 * HappinessColumn tooltip now shows the english version of the happiness level
 * Skills now correctly read experience (Fixed issue 1)
 * fixed issue 58 (can't repro it anymore)
 * Added ability to toggle an entire set at once for a dwarf or a group of
   dwarfs
 * added support for 40d14
 * (Fixed issue 5): Show skill-ratings legend somewhere
 * Moved the dock config around. Views, Sets, and Skill legend docks are now
   off by default and can be turned on in a variety of ways. They also default
   to floating windows that can be docked.
 * (Fixed issue 42): Hangs if game saved/continued without reloading
 * DT now heartbeats every second to DF. It a fort is unloaded or the game
   exits, DT will disconnect and allow reconnection.
 * (Implemented issue 40): Profession mgmt - separate file/export
 * Fixed a minor drawing bug with selected rows not showing the main grid
   underneath
 * Fixed a bug where the Viewmanager would try to draw tabs with invalid indexes
 * (Fixed issue 55): Confirm overwrite if View or Set name exists
    This dialog only pops up when you aren't editing. To prevent accidental
    clobbering.
    Cases where it shows up:
       Edit View1, change the name to View2(which already exists)
       New view, change the name to View2(which already exists)
       Will not show up on edit if the original name was View3 and you save it as
         View3.
    Since it doesn't show up in the general case, I've opted to not implement
    the "don't ask me again" checkbox
 * (Fixed issue 54) Blank name is allowed for set name
 * (Fixed issue 53) Main window doesn't show changes after changing group by
 * generic_useless.ini set wasn't correct, so I removed it
 * StateTableView now remembers which rows were expanded and which weren't
 * Setting the group by now goes thru ViewManager so the columns don't get
   stretched incorrectly
 * (Fixed issue 57) Dwarf Name column resets to fixed-width
 * (Fixed issue 63) Options Window Duplicates Custom Professions
 * (Fixes issue 61) customizable skill icons
 * (Fixes issue 62) option to turn of shading
 * some minor speedups based on a trial of profiler
 * Dwarf::nice_name() is now cached since it hardly ever changes
 * GameDataReader now caches skill names and skill level names (and uses them)
 * UberDelegate now passes adjusted rectangles by reference to the sub-painters
   for less stack thrashing
 * Less QString::operator+ usage, since it seems to cause reallocations and is
   generally slow as fucking hell
 * Found some spots where build_rows() was being called multiple times and
   being slow
