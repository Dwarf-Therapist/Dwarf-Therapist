ROLES
- any roles you wish to be loaded into DT as default roles should be put into the game_data.ini file under the [dwarf_roles] section

VIEWS
- any views you wish to be loaded into DT should be put into the default_gridviews.dtg. if you want to replace one of DT's default views, simply ensure that the name of the view you create in default_gridviews.dtg is the same as the original view name. if the name does not match one of the original default views, it will be added as an additional default view.

OTHER
- the game_data.ini also contains descriptions for things like labors, jobs, thoughts, attributes, etc. which can be changed as you like.
