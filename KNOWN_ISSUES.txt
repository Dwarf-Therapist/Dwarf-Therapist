KNOWN ISSUES
==============================================================================
 * - Setting Mining and Woodcutting -
   Setting these labors rely on the dwarf already having the proper equipment
   (pick or axe). These labors should be manually set in game for now.

 * - Migration Waves Incorrect -
   The group-by "Migration Wave" is based on some shady guesswork
   based on dwarf ids. It is in no way 100% accurate, but can sometimes amaze 
   me that it works :)
   
 * - Dwarf and Squad Names -
   This is brute force word-list searching. Verb conjugation, plurality and 
   case are a crapshoot. But it's generally pretty close.
  
 * - Unknown - 
   If you come across some other weird error, please post a bug report here:
   http://code.google.com/p/dwarftherapist/issues/entry and paste the 
   "run.log" file from the "log" directory into the bug report (or attach it)
   
   You can increase the amount of logging by running DwarfTherapist.exe with
   the "-trace" argument. You can do this via the shortcut, or via the command
   line
