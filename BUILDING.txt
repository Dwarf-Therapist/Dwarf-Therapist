Instructions for how to build from source are as follows:

For Windows, download the QTCreator IDE and open the dwarftherapist.pro file.  You can build
from within QTCreator.

For Linux, do the following:

# Install required packages
* qtchooser
* qtbase5-dev
* qtbase5-dev-tools
* qtscript5-dev
* qt5-qmake
* libqt5script5
* libqt5scripttools5
* libqxt-core0 
* libqxt-gui0

For Debian-derived (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.) distributions, you can run the following command from a terminal:

    > sudo apt-get install qtchooser qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools qtscript5-dev qt5-qmake libqt5script5 libqt5scripttools5 libqxt-core0 libqxt-gui0


# Clone the project using git
Clone the project to wherever you like.  The location doesn't really matter.

    > git clone git://github.com/splintermind/Dwarf-Therapist.git


# Build the project

    > cd Dwarf-Therapist
    > qmake -qt=5
    > make

This will take some time.  Get a cup of coffee.  Once your build is complete, run

    > sudo make install

If you want, you can now remove the folder you cloned from github.

If your build fails for whatever reason, the easiest way to start over again is to go to wherever you cloned the project and run

    > rm -rf Dwarf-Therapist

and you can restart with cloning the project.

If you are having problems with building, ask on the Splintermind thread in the Bay12Forums.  (http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=122968)


# Run the program
The executable is in your /usr/bin folder  You will have to run it as sudo, i.e.:

    > sudo DwarfTherapist


# Uninstallation

You can remove the program two ways:

Automated: if you still have the folder you cloned from github, run
    > sudo make uninstall
in that directory.

Manually: using sudo rm -rf, remove:

* /usr/bin/X11/dwarftherapist
* /usr/share/dwarftherapist/*
* /usr/share/applications/dwarftherapist.desktop
* /usr/share/doc/dwarftherapist/*
* /usr/share/pixmaps/dwarftherapist.png
* /usr/share/pixmaps/dwarftherapist.xpm
