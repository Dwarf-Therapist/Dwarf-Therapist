This is the maintained version of `Splintermind's Dwarf Therapist`_ (itself a heavily modified version of the `original Dwarf Therapist`_).

Latest Release
========
The `latest release`_ is always published in the project's `releases`_ page. These releases normally contain packages for Windows and OSX.

Alternate Download (DFFD)
-------------------------
If the latest published releases do not contain a package, they may be found on DFFD.

`Windows 32-bit <http://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=13094>`_

`Windows 64-bit <http://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=13095>`_

The manual for Dwarf Therapist can be downloaded separately.

`Stand-alone Manual <http://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=7889>`_

Building
========

Dwarf-Therapist requires a C++ compiler (with C++14 support), cmake (3.1.0 or newer), and Qt5 (with Widgets and QML modules).

Create a build directory, then, from it, run cmake and make::

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Linux users can install Dwarf Therapist by running ``make install``. The destination directory can be changed by passing the ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/dwarftherapist`` option to cmake (e.g. ``cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local ..`` for a user-local installation).

CMake options
-------------

Add ``-D<option name>=ON|OFF`` to cmake command line to enable or disable an optional feature.

BUILD_MANUAL (default: OFF)
  Enables building the PDF manual using Latex.
 
Linux
=====
There is currently no official package for Linux.

Running the program
-------------------
On default installations of most Debian-based distributions, you'll most likely need to run Dwarf Therapist with sudo.
This is due to the `Yama ptrace LSM`_ enabled by default on such distros.
You can explicitly give Dwarf Therapist permission to ptrace on Debian-based distributions with::

    sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin && sudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace=eip ./bin/release/DwarfTherapist

Or, you can create a script that will run Dwarf Therapist as a child of Dwarf Fortress::

    #!/bin/bash
    set -e
    cd df_linux
    ./df &
    cd ../dwarftherapist
    exec ./bin/release/DwarfTherapist

Alternatively, you can use the ``dist/dwarftherapist`` wrapper to automatically grant DT permissions to attach to a running DF process.

Support
=======
Primary support is available at the `Dwarf Therapist thread`_ at the Bay 12 Forums; if you are sure you have found a bug, file an issue at the `GitHub issue tracker`_.
Provide as much information as possible to help reproduce the issue.
Most runtime bugs will require you to send a save, preferably uploaded at `DFFD`_.
You may also be requested to provide a log, which is saved in ``log/log.txt`` on Windows and OSX and output to stderr on Linux systems (use ``2> log.txt`` to collect).

You can also join us in `#dwarftherapist on Freenode`_.
